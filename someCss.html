		Washington (CNN)As a 43-year-old youth counselor from Sacramento, California, Brian Dempsey certainly did not fit the traditional profile of someone likely to travel to Syria in hopes of joining ISIS -- but his journey is helping shed new light on why some Americans decide to fight alongside extremists in combat zones on the other side of the world.

		Dempsey is one of 64 Americans whose experiences in Iraq and Syria were profiled as part of a new report released Monday by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.
		After working as a youth counselor for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for over a decade, Dempsey converted to Islam sometime between 2011 and 2013 before initially traveling to Syria in 2013 to "participate in combat," according to the report and court documents.
